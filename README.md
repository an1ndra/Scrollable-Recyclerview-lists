There are a number of pieces involved in creating and using a `RecyclerView`. You can think of them as a division of labor. The diagram below shows
an overview, and you will learn more about each piece as you implement it.

- **item** - One data item of the list to display. Represents one `Affirmation` object in your app.
- **Adapter** - Takes data and prepares it for `RecyclerView` to display.
- **ViewHolders** - A pool of views for `RecyclerView` to use and reuse to display affirmations.
- **RecyclerView** - Views on screen
